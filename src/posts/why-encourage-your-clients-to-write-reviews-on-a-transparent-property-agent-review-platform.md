As a real estate agent, building trust with your clients is paramount to your success. While some agents have a natural gift for persuasion, others rely on a numbers game, which can yield mixed results.

At Better Agents, we advocate for a more effective way to establish trust – showcasing the positive experiences you've provided to previous clients through reviews on a transparent property agent review platform.

## Reviews are important

We all recognize the power of word-of-mouth in marketing, and in its absence, online reviews step in as a close second. Studies show that 92% of customers read online reviews before making purchasing decisions, with 70% trusting reviews and recommendations from strangers. The process of choosing a real estate agent is no different.

Anybody can make unattainable promises and bold claims, but potential clients want to know if you can deliver on those promises. The opinions of your past clients carry immense weight in their decision-making process.

Your agency or team leader has probably stressed the importance of gathering good reviews from previous customers, and you've likely collected numerous testimonials to display on your website or social media. However, there's a common issue with this approach…

## Customers trust testimonials on a transparent review site more

Since agents understand the need for positive reviews, many showcase a slew of glowing 5-star testimonials on their social media, websites, or marketing materials. The problem is that this practice makes every agent seem indistinguishable from the rest. Clients are aware that agents cherry-pick only the best reviews to display.

With about 10,000 active real estate agents in Singapore, cold outreach becomes less effective because clients struggle to differentiate one agent from another.

To stand out from your peers, encourage your clients to write reviews on an impartial property agent review platform like Better Agents [link]. When a platform is unbiased and impartial in collecting and displaying reviews, these reviews tend to hold more weight. 5 reviews on a property agent review site hold significantly more credibility than 50 curated testimonials on an agent's website or social media.

## My friend is an agent

Finally, the biggest challenge to cold outreach is that many people still prefer to engage an agent who is a friend or a friend’s recommendation. This preference often stems from the scarcity of information available to clients. Unable to discern between agents, they naturally lean towards a familiar face.

We believe that by having your reviews on a trustworthy and transparent property agent review platform, potential clients gain access to reliable information about which agents excel. This shift can break the cycle of relying solely on "my friend is an agent" for recommendations.

Getting started is simple. Search for your agent profile [link] and share it with your clients, guiding them through the straightforward review-writing process.
