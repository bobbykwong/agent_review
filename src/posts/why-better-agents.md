It‚Äôs 2023, the property market is showing signs of recovery from the challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic. Property agents are now thriving more than ever before, and an increasing number of aspiring agents are eagerly taking the RES (Real Estate Salesperson) Exam, seeking their opportunity in the lucrative real estate industry.

With a total of 34,427 CEA licensed agents (as of September 16, 2023), it can be quite a daunting task for individuals to find the right agent when buying, selling, or leasing their homes.

## The problem I faced

I found myself facing this issue firsthand when helping my mother in renting out her property. We were in search of an agent to help us find tenants and manage the leasing process. The biggest challenge we encountered was that every agent, with their numerous accolades, record transactions, and glowing "testimonials" on their personal websites, appeared indistinguishable from one another.

While we could have simply engaged the first agent who left a flyer in our mailbox, we couldn't ignore the fact that the agent's fee for our two-year lease equated to approximately one month's rent. It didn't make sense for us to make such an important decision with limited information and simply rely on a first-come, first-served basis.

This issue is particularly relevant to individuals buying or selling their homes. Property transactions are substantial undertakings that typically occur only once or twice in an average Singaporean's lifetime. Therefore, why should anyone entrust an agent with such significant responsibilities, especially when they have limited knowledge of the agent's credentials, all while incurring a substantial commission fee?

## Property Agent Review site as the solution

This dilemma led me to contemplate the vital information that consumers should have at their disposal before selecting their real estate agent. Naturally, most people would want to gauge how effectively an agent has served previous clients and whether the agent's style aligns with their own preferences. As a result, we believe that a property agent review platform, which compiles honest and constructive reviews, would best serve both consumers and agents alike.

We think that anyone who has had an experience with an agent in their capacity as an agent should be allowed to leave a review. Here‚Äôs our [review policy](https://www.betteragents.sg/reviews-policy) for further elaboration. As more reviews are added to the site, we hope that greater transparency will be introduced to the real estate agent market and consumers will be able to find Better Agents üòÅ
